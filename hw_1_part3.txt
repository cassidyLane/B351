Part 3 Answers:

1. We believe the most informative information to provide to the algorithm is distance from the current board to the
goal board and the number of elements not in order. By choosing a move that will decrease these, the search algorithm
will be able to choose optimal moves, discounting ones that are less effective.

2. Problem difficulty in this domain corresponds to the number of moves the board has to go through to reach the goal
state. If the board has to go to more boards then it needs to expand more children boards, expanding the frontier and
number of nodes that have to then be searched.

3. The experimental setup consisted of feeding the testing functions boards with a given amount of steps in the path to
the goal: 1 - 10. We then recorded the execution times to determine differences between uninformed and informed
search algorithms. A* improved both speed and maximum difficulty of problems in most cases. It improved on speed because
it explored the best option depending on cost of the move, determined through heuristics. It improved on maximum
difficulty because it is able to compute on paths greater than the general search could. This is because it again employs
heuristics to help it solve, and reduce the amount of steps taken in the path.
